## Quick Start for LaTeX
1. [**OverLeaf.com**](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv/tvmzpvdjfqxp)(formerly **WriteLaTeX.com**)
2. [**ShareLaTeX.com**](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/awesome-cv)


## How to Use
### Requirements
A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

### Usage
At a command prompt, run
```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```
This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``


## Credit
### Awesome CV
[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **resume** or **cover letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

### LaTeX
LaTeX is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia.

You can find out more about it here: [LaTeX Project](http://www.latex-project.org)
